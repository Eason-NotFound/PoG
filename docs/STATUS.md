## Current milestone

M1 — MockHKD and PoGRegistry implementation, awaiting CEO review. Escrow custody,
human approvals, reservation, and payment remain unauthorized and unimplemented.

## Completed

- Inspected repository: it was an empty Git repository on `main`, with no commits,
  no `AGENTS.md`, and no existing user files to overwrite.
- Added a dependency-free Foundry layout and `Smoke.t.sol`.
- Frozen product decisions, roles, canonical structures, full procurement state
  machine, funds invariants, 6-decimal amount policy, EIP-712 domains/types and
  terms hashes, core functions/events, integration responsibilities, confirmation
  rules, error mapping, and idempotency.
- Created placeholders for source, scripts, deployment manifests, and generated
  ABI hand-off without implementing business contracts.
- Repaired deployment topology: Registry-first deployment, immutable Registry in
  Escrow, and one-time mutually verified Escrow binding in Registry.
- Split `RegistryProject`, `EscrowProjectAccount`, and API-composed
  `ProjectView`; removed refund/closure accounting from MVP.
- Bound both AI stages to exact on-chain-recomputed pre/final evidence hashes.
- Froze public entrypoints, counterpart-only hooks/callbacks, call order, atomic
  rollback, reentrancy assumptions, and Foundation-only policy changes.
- Implemented `MockHKD` with 6 decimals and unrestricted, zero-safe demo minting.
- Implemented `PoGRegistry` project/procurement lifecycle, one-time Escrow
  binding, exact evidence hashes, AI signer allowlist, EIP-712 assessments,
  nonce/expiry enforcement, policy orchestration, cancellation, Allocation Roots,
  pause controls, counterpart-only callbacks, and API/Escrow read helpers.
- Pinned OpenZeppelin Contracts `v5.7.0` and forge-std `v1.16.2` to their
  recorded tag commits.
- Added Registry test doubles and unit/fuzz coverage for valid and adversarial
  binding, hooks, lifecycle, evidence, signatures, nonces, expiry, policy,
  cancellation, and Allocation Roots.
- Generated versioned `MockHKD` and `PoGRegistry` ABI JSON from Forge output.

## Verification status

M1 is verified locally on 2026-10-02 with:

```text
Forge 1.8.4
commit 50af4efe189dc64bad2b75ed6990b835de66c4ae
Solc 0.8.24
```

The execution shell does not include `~/.foundry/bin` in `PATH`, so commands
prepend that directory. Final required commands are:

```text
forge fmt --check
forge build
forge test -vv
git diff --check
```

Formatting, compilation, and diff checks pass with no residual compiler/lint
warnings. The full suite passes 44/44 tests: 36 Registry, 7 MockHKD, and 1 smoke
test, including three 256-run fuzz tests. Generated ABI JSON syntax validation also
passes.

## Scope guard

- No `ProcurementEscrow.sol` custody, approval, reservation, or payment implementation.
- No deployment, PR, commit, push, merge, proxy, NFT, DAO, real stablecoin,
  cross-chain, Chainlink, or zkML work.

## Next gate

M1 technical review has passed, including an independent full-suite rerun,
strict source lint, ABI comparison and 2,000 runs of each of three fuzz tests.
Stop at M1 and report to the user. Explicit user authorization is required before
M2 starts. See `docs/VERSION_CONTROL.md` for repository publication and version gates.
